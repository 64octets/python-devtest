# Python Developer Test

A simple test to show that a web developer knows how to use basic tools and understands the basics of the Python language.

> Make sure your code is compatible with the [latest versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of Python 2 and 3. Thanks!

##  Tests

Please fork this repository, clone it down, and then when you finish a test commit/push your code to Github and submit a pull request.

Write unit tests to prove that the function works.

### Part 1: Python Basics

## String Reverse

1. Create a function called `reverse()` that reverses a string.
1. Add your solution to the "part1/reverse-string" folder in a new folder called "reverse_yourlastname".

#### Count Vowels

1. Create a function called `vowel_counter()` that takes a string as an argument and returns the sum of each vowel found.
1. Add your solution to the "part1/vowel-counter" folder in a new folder called "counter_yourlastname".

### Part 2: Web Development with Flask

1. Using Flask, create a simple website that has a single form entry field with a submit button.
1. Submitting the form will result in the submitted text shown in reverse on the next page.
1. Add your solution to the "part2" folder in a new folder called "reverse_flask_yourlastname".
1. Commit/push your code up to Heroku
1. Update the *part2/README.md* file in this repository with the publicly accessible URL
1. Commit/push to Github and submit a pull request.

### Todo

1. Add additional tests to part 1
1. Add Django Test
1. Add Pyramid Test
1. Add web2py Test
1. Create web app
